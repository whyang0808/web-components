This repository contains a WYSIWYG editor for markdown that conforms to the [CommonMark](https://spec.commonmark.org) specification which can handle Accord Project's smart contract technology.

The editor is based on React, [Slate](https://www.slatejs.org), and the Accord Project [`markdown-transform` project](https://github.com/accordproject/markdown-transform).
